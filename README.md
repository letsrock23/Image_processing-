# Image_processing-
This device can identify Fighter Jet from images. 
Device completed with ESP32 Cam module and use arduino nano for get power up the ESP32 cam.

First I was a train a model with some fighter jets pictures with help of Edge Impulse platfrom also can do this with python jupyter lab. After train the model convert it lite formet version using tensorflow lite to deploy to the microconttroler. 

Dont need to train the model again to work this device just upload the given code to the ESP32 cam and play.
